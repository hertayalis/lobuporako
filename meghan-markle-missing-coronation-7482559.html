Some reports noted that their kids' <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>exclusion from the festivities</a> contributed to Meghan's decision to skip the big day, but a source close to the couple told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>People</a> that the media and wide-spread scrutiny also had something to do with Meghan's decision.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Meghan wants to be there to support her father-in-law, but at the same time, the scrutiny she receives outweighs the support,"&nbsp;the insider said. "There's always going to be that other side challenging their reasoning, and who wants to put themselves in that position?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith&nbsp;added that using the children as her reason was "an elegant solution,"&nbsp;and Archie's birthday "gave them a reasonable out for Meghan not to come."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another friend told the publication that while Charles is "pleased" with Harry's RSVP, there most likely won't be that reconciliation everyone has been hoping for. "At this point, it's become so personal,"&nbsp;the source said. &nbsp;"Maybe what they wanted wasn't achieved, but at the end of the day, he's going there to support his dad."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A palace insider added, "It would have been quite significant if Harry hadn't attended his father's coronation, but I'm not surprised Meghan isn't going given the circumstances."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And although Harry probably won't have a large role in the coronation (including the coveted balcony appearance), he "will happily go along with whatever the plan is."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last week, royal expert <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennie Bond commended</a> Harry for making the decision to attend. "Now that we know that he's coming, I'm very glad that he is coming to what is probably the most important day in his father's life â€” it would have been churlish not to do so," Bond told OK!.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJ6eoZmeYrqivsqlnGalmajAqrrGZpqoqp%2BjrrW1zqdkcGxoZ4J2hQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
