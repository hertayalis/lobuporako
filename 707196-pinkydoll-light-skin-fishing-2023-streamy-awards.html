Alabama Barker is one person who's often faced with accusations like this, though the teen continues to let them roll off her back as she moves forward in her hip-hop career. On the other end of the spectrum is PinkyDoll, who caused some serious commotion with her appearance at the 2023 Streamy Awards.</p><p>Viewers weren't expecting to see the <a href=# rel>NPC content creator</a> take the stage at the annual event, but she happily presented Kai Cenat with his well-deserved trophy.

Many have confessed that they've always thought the Canadian is a "yellow bone," when in reality, she's a brown-skinned girl.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>Alabama Barker’s Rap Video Earns Her Blackfishing Accusations: Watch</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-pinkydoll-looks-noticeably-different-during-first-public-appearance>PinkyDoll Looks Noticeably Different During First Public Appearance</h2></span><p>Some of those chiming in are of the opinion that altering her appearance is intentional on PinkyDoll's part, perhaps in hopes of attracting a wider audience. "PinkyDoll using colourism to get the bag was an elite game plan," one Twitter user reflected on Monday (August 28) evening. "Yes yes yes, brown skin so good," they further joked.</p><p>"People been benefitting off blackfishing so I’m not even mad at PinkyDoll for doing the reverse," someone else wrote in defense of the <a href=# rel>OnlyFans model.</a> "Stop being colourist then." Still, there are some who think it's wrong of the 27-year-old to trick her audience like this.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>Ice Spice’s Next Collab Could Be PinkyDoll, If NPC Streamer Has Her Way</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Social Media Reacts</h2></span><p>Keep scrolling to see what Twitter users are saying about PinkyDoll's first major public appearance at the 2023 Streamy Awards.
