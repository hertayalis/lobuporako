News</a> took a look at just how private they really are. According to them, there's plenty of appearances, photos, and even red carpet appearances that they both did prior to the start of their relationship and even a bit at the beginning. They were on the red carpet together for The Place Beyond the Pines, the film they met on and promoted together. After that, the magazine notes they sort of retreated from public life as much as possible — at least while on each others' arms.</p><p>They also found that Mendes has an almost strange dislike of talking about Gosling, and hardly even acknowledges him on social media. She's stopped interviews where she's been asked about him, and when a reporter from The Edit asked her about Gosling in 2013, she was quoted as responding, "I'm sorry. I'm shutting down. I'm such a weirdo. I literally lose my ability to speak — and you were doing so well."</p><p>When it comes to his turn in front of the media, he's said that she doesn't like him talking about her or their relationship, either. With the arrival of their daughters, she's even more strict about protecting their privacy. During her pregnancies, she said she was absolutely staying out of the public eye — and off the red carpet — because becoming a parent made her even more wary of privacy issues. "[...] I find the media's 'bump watch' obsession to be both intrusive and stressful," she said in 2014. "So I made a decision to eject myself from it completely. I was like, 'Annnnd I'm out.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbmlian1wvsSao2aqlZbAsLqMnq2aZZ2au6Wx0malnq6Vp3qru8inqmaqqZa7brPOrKOippdiv6awjJyYq6iVqXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
