Usually, they appear as an <a href=#>outage</a>, where thousands of users will be unable to log on or use an app properly without it crashing or simply not working.

Depending on the perks you unlock or the technical know-how you can utilize you can change and mod your character to look however you want. Most everyone has the same blocky avatar, but you can still adjust their skins and outward appearance to your liking. Namely, you can add hair or headgear to your avatar. You even have the option of not wearing anything on your head at all.</p><p>However, a particularly strange glitch in Roblox forced a significant number of players to forcibly appear bald. Starting on Apr. 4, several users took to platforms like Twitter to report that their characters were bald for seemingly no reason. The glitch had apparently spread to several players.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Try Hard Guides</a> reported that it was simply an "unexpected" but "temporary glitch," which can plague any platform from time to time.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>omg Roblox just broke and its giving everyone free bald haircuts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ðŸ˜¯ðŸ’€ðŸª’ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AtnzL2JRd6</a></p>â€” Captain Steve (COMISSION CLOSED)ðŸ§¢ ðŸ”¥ (@CaptainSteve_RB) <a href=#>April 4, 2023</a></figure><p>One user on Twitter <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">theorized</a> that anyone using the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">R15 avatar body</a> may be subject to this glitch.
