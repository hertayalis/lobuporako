The fearless hardhat installed a beam on the 104th floor that was signed by President Obama and even helped set the spire without being tied down.</p><p>Sometimes clocking as many as 70 hours in a work week, Brady would spend the night at the job site in a sleeping bag because he was often too exhausted to make the 55-mile trek home to Long Island.</p><p>But for years, the thrill-seeker couldn’t shake the idea of launching himself off the tower.</p><p>“I’m working on this building. What do I want to do? I want to jump off,” said Brady, who has approximately 700 skydive and BASE jumps — in which a parachutist leaps from a fixed object — under his belt.</p><p>“Working on heights and dealing with fear — I thrive on those things.”</p><p>On Sept. 30, <a href=#>Brady and fellow daredevils Andrew Rossig and Marko Markovich</a> snuck through a hole in a fence covered only with a tarp before making their way to the top of One World Trade.</p><p><a href=#>With a camera attached to one of their helmets</a>, the men recorded their leap.</p><p>Brady scoffs at the reckless-endangerment charge that the trio were slapped with.</p><p>“If there was any risk taken, it was my own risk and no one else’s,” Brady said, touting his long history of successful jumps.</p><p>“There was nobody on the street. Nobody on the sidewalk. I can control [the parachute] to exactly where I want to land.”</p><p>The stunt was the first in what has become a long line of security lapses at One World Trade Center.</p><p>Last month, New Jersey teen Justin Casquejo snuck past security guards before taking the elevator to the top of the building to take pictures.</p><p>Last week, a man who had an interview for a construction job walked through an open security gate and managed to walk right past a security guard before someone stopped him.</p><p>That security guard has since been relieved of his duties and reassigned.</p><p>Additional reporting by Daniel Prendergast</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfnV7j21mamxfrMGkec%2BaqZqbmKrBqr%2FTZqCtq12WerC6wp5koqZdlnqttcWeq6KllWK3trnPaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
