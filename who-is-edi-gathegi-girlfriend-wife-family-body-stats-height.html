His net worth could be expected to be a small amount in the years to come as his profile continues to rise.&nbsp;Gathegi has also received a number of awards and nominations throughout his career.&nbsp;One of them is his award for Leading Role at the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family – girlfriend, wife</span></strong></h2><p><span>Edi Gathegi looks like a little lady is known about his private life.&nbsp;The talented actor has kept his personal life very personal, deterring distress from media sources.&nbsp;Despite his friendliness to the ladies, Gathegi, the middle child in his family, never showed up to any lady.&nbsp;This may mean that he is not in a romantic relationship with anyone.&nbsp;The verifiable information about Gathegi is that he is not married at the moment and has no child of his own.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height, weight, body stats</span></strong></h2><p><span>Edi Gathegi has a good stature which perfectly matches his acting profession.&nbsp;He stands at a height of 6′ 1” which is quite proportional to his weight of 59 kg.&nbsp;From the description it can be deduced that the slim figure of the actor undoubtedly gives him an advantage over his peers.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMnpuiZZeWwamxxqJkoKGiobOztcSnm2avmZuybrLApqClsV2XvKXFjKyrmqyjYrWmtcahq2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
