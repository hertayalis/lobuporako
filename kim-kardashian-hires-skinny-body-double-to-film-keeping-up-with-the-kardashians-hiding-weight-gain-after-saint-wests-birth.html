And, when she steps out in front of the paparazzi, she has been sporting very unstylish head to toe coats that are three sizes too large to try and cover up the extra pounds.</p><p>Despite Kim’s desperate attempts to keep her growing waistline underwraps, she was having a difficult time pulling it off while filming Keeping Up With The Kardashians. So, it looks like Kim has put a body double, Kami Osman, on her payroll to handle the full-body shots for her.</p><p>Kim’s BFF Jonathan Cheban was recently spotted with what the press deduced was his new girlfriend – who also was a slimmed down dead ringer for Kim.</p><p>But, some nosey fans on the internet did some digging and came to the conclusion that the woman was not John’s girlfriend at all – but a fake Kim. Johnathan and Kim 2.0 were photographed leaving the Epione Cosmetic Laser Center in Beverly Hills.</p><p>A few moments later, Jonathan was photographed leaving the same place with skinny Kim&nbsp;who was Kami Osman.&nbsp;Here’s the kicker – the KUWTK camera crew weren’t following Kim Kardashian, they were following Jonathan and Kim 2.0.</p><p>Honestly, we can’t wait until this footage starts airing on Keeping Up With The Kardashians. We are seriously intrigued as to how they are going to edit the clips to make the faux Kim pass as the real one.
