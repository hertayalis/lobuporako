Adorable and engaging, he is easily forgiven, and his attractive personality magnetizes a lot of attention.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">And even though the British royal family are staunch supporters of following order and tradition, Prince Louis stands out.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Louis is born to be his own person,” Frank continued. “His birth chart doesn’t share the astrological blueprint usually associated with the steadfast, sensible sign of Taurus. Louis’s Taurus qualities are overlit by Uranus, the wild child planet, which was positioned close to his Sun when he was born.” Wild child planet? Sounds like it was named after Prince Louis!&nbsp; <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2157334681-1-e1720555833454.jpg alt="Angelina Jolie at the 77th Annual Tony Awards held at the David H.

He is likely to shake things up, add some mischief and disruption into the mix,” Frank added. These personality traits, and the fact that Louis has a “determined Mars in Capricorn,” can cause some tension between him and his mother.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“He is the one person who can make her lose her cool!
