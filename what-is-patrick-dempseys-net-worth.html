His grasp of romance, in particular, is a major <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">draw behind the 57-year-old star</a>, a fact that’s written across his resume. Some of his most popular projects are rom-com classics, with favorites like Made of Honor, Sweet Home Alabama, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Enchanted films </a>cropping up in frequent annual rewatches. He’s even dipped his toes into horror a few times over the years, with the upcoming Thanksgiving serving as a long-overdue return more than two decades after he appeared in Scream 3.</p><p data-characters=490 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>Then there’s Dempsey’s career as an auto racer. He’s maintained and collected sports and vintage vehicles for years now, and in the early 2010s he started to establish himself as a racer to watch. What was once considered a hobby is now a permanent fixture in Dempsey’s life, and has seen him compete in a range of high profile races. He’s even placed in a few, including 2006’s Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race and, more recently, the 2015 24 Hours of Le Mans.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>Dempsey’s talent reaches far beyond the screen, but it’s largely his work in acting that the star has to thank for his current prominence — and his current freedom. Money makes for a far more carefree live, and Dempsey is absolutely rolling in it.</p><h2 id=h-patrick-dempsey-s-net-worth-explained data-injectable=false>Patrick Dempsey’s net worth, explained</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Patrick_Dempsey_net_worth.jpg><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grey’s Anatomy alone</a> was enough to make Dempsey a millionaire, with later seasons of the series paying him a whopping $350,000 per episode. That totaled out to around $8 million a season, and served as a huge financial cushion for Dempsey in the years after he departed the ABC favorite.</p><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=736 data-injectable=true>Those $8 million annual payouts make up the bulk of Dempsey’s $85 million net worth, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, but not all of it. After all, the star had a hefty career long before he met Rhimes, starring in a range of hugely successful romantic comedies, dramas, and even those rare horror flicks. He’d already proven himself to be a heartthrob ahead of the soapy show, which was exactly why he caught Rhimes’ eye.</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>Dempsey isn’t likely to be in any more Grey’s Anatomy-esque projects in the future, so long as his current wealth holds up. With $85 million in the bank, money certainly isn’t a problem for the star, which frees him up to spend more time on his passions — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his family</a>, his cars, and his racing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZaCWwbO1wqRknZ2dpcCmxdJmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
