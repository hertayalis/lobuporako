Avery shared the stage with R&B great Babyface, recipient of 12 Grammy Awards. Babyface performed for the audience while the young saxophonist danced in a stunning pink silk outfit. Aidan was part of the first closing number of the night as he floated in the air behind Adam Lambert while he sang a cover of 'Chandelier' by Sia.</p><p>The tension on the show was palpable across the screen as Aiden and Avery were the top two contestants. Terry said, "This competition was about finding the best Got Talent act in the world. 11 acts started the night with hopes of winning, we're in the top two." As fireworks lit up the stage, Terry declared that Aiden had won the crown. The winner immediately began to cry.</p><h2 class=split>'The wrong person won,' say fans&nbsp;</h2><p>While Avery was a gracious second runner-up, his loyal Twitter followers criticized AGT for allegedly "rigging" the results and stealing the win from the saxophonist. One fan tweeted, "The superfans who voted on #AGTAllStars were bad every week, but the fact that Kodi Lee, Tom Ball, and Avery Dixon lost is embarrassingly awful. The wrong person won… Who are these “superfans” anyway?!" Another one said, "Between the final 2 on #AGTAllStars tonight, should have gone to Avery Dixon - he was most improved, no disrespect intended for Aidan. @AGT. One more fan added, "Avery Dixon should have won this thing. #AGTAllStars."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>The superfans who voted on <a href=#>#AGTAllStars</a> were bad every week, but the fact that Kodi Lee, Tom Ball and Avery Dixon lost is embarrassingly awful.
