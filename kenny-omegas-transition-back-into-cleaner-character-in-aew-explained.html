He was right on time for the #1 contender eliminator tournament as he defeated Sonny Kiss in seconds.</p><p><a href=#>Click here for our complete coverage of AEW Dynamite from this week.</a></p><p>During <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Radio</a>, Dave Meltzer explained Omega’s intentions. He said that the first year was supposed to show Omega in a different way than he was previously represented. This year he will focus on being the wrestler that fans expected of him from the get-go.</p><p>“The first year was Kenny Omega trying to elevate people, you know working the tag team with Page and getting that going and the second year is going to be the Kenny Omega that everyone thought he was going to be in the first year. That ring entrance was the key to the whole thing.”</p><p>The Cleaner is back and he’s slated to take on Rey Fenix next week on Dynamite. We’ll have to see how things turn out for Kenny Omega’s shift back into a familar gimmick, but he’s off to a great start.</p><p>Transcription by <a href=#>Ringside News</a></p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
