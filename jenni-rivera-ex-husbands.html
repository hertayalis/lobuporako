A molestation case was opened in 1997, but Jenni's first husband wasn't apprehended until 2006 after nine years of running from the law.</p><p>In 2007, he was sentenced to 31 years in prison without parole for sexually abusing Rosie, Chiquis, and his youngest daughter, Jacqui.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Jenni Rivera divorce Juan Lopez?</h2><p>Juan López and Jenni married in 1997, two years after they met in LA.

"I lost my mother two months before on October 2. It was a misunderstanding. My world ended on that day. Every day I have to live with this, no one knows the pain I carry, especially because it was a misunderstanding, there were so many people in the middle that caused so much pain, so many problems that it was impossible not to be upset."</p><p>As for Jenni's true love and soulmate, Fernie, he's still making music today.</p><p>Stream Mariposa de Barrio on Netflix to learn more about Jenni and the many things that happened over the course of her short life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KvushmqaKulaeubrHXZp%2Buq5KWu6W%2F</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
