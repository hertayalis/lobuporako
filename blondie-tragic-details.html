"I was trying to get across town to an after-hours club. A little white car pulls up, and the guy offers me a ride," Harry told a reporter in 1989 (via <a href=#>Dazed</a>). It was a short distance, and Harry accepted, but once she got inside the vehicle, she realized something was amiss. The Volkswagen Beetle was without many interior features, including the radio, window rollers, and door handles. Feeling the immediate need to escape, Harry managed to get the door open from the outside, and while forcing her way out, the driver took a sharp turn, sending the musician tumbling out of the speeding car.</p><p>Harry says she didn't think about the unsettling event until 1989, after reading about the execution of Ted Bundy, a serial killer who murdered women around the United States in the 1970s. "The whole description of how he operated and what he looked like and the kind of car he drove and the time frame he was doing that in that area of the country fit exactly. I said, 'My God, it was him.'" While there's no reason to doubt Harry's account, it's unlikely that she survived an encounter with Bundy; he was living in the western U.S., far from New York, in the mid-1970s. Harry's potential assailant remains an anonymous, unidentified unsavory character.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9k25wa2hpZK%2Btu82doJ5lpKeuqLXCZpuerJGeubR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
