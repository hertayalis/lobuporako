She and Hartnett made headlines after they were spotted locking lips outside a restaurant in New York City that December,&nbsp;according to an old report by Page Six.&nbsp;"They were all over each other," an eyewitness told the outlet&nbsp;at the time, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">CelebBitchy</a>. Back then, Hartnett had also just gotten out of a relationship with his longtime girlfriend, Scarlett Johansson.&nbsp;He and Johansson dated for two years after meeting on the set of their 2006 film "Black Dahlia," but later split due to their busy schedules.&nbsp;"It was difficult spending so much time apart with all our different commitments and both of us flying all over the world,"&nbsp;Hartnet explained to the<a href=#>&nbsp;Mirror</a> about their "really painful" breakup.&nbsp;"At the end of the day, we're just ordinary people, and it didn't work," he added.</p><p>Per Page Six, reps for both Bündchen and Hartnett refused to comment on their public make-out sesh at that time. However, it seems things fizzled out between the two just as quickly, as&nbsp;Bündchen soon&nbsp;started dating her would-be husband, NFL star Tom Brady. As for Hartnett, the "Operation Fortune"&nbsp;actor went on to date other A-list stars, but he's now happily married.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampka4N0fo6goKydnJp6o8HNnZqhnZ5is621zaBko6ejnXqprdGtpZ6spGKvprLOq5xmrJ%2BieqO%2BwJ2waA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
