Born from Marvel’s collaboration with rights holders Universal before they truly struck out on their own, the events of the movie were quickly swept under the rug and never mentioned again.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=483 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>In fact, if it wasn’t for William Hurt making a surprise return as Thaddeus Ross in Captain America: Civil War, you could remove The Incredible Hulk from canon completely and it wouldn’t change a single thing about the MCU. Edward Norton was replaced by Mark Ruffalo and Louis Leterrier’s movie was never mentioned again, nobody else from the cast appeared in any of the franchise’s other projects, and none of the story threads hinted at were ever picked up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/world-war-hulk.jpg><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>Even in the awkwardly shoehorned in post-credits scene with Robert Downey Jr., Ross is the only character that he shares the screen with, so if Hurt had either declined the opportunity to return or there was no role for him in the scripts for Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, the MCU would simply continue to roll on without even acknowledging the fact that their second-ever movie existed, and it wouldn’t have made a shred of difference to the Infinity Saga.</p><p data-characters=497 data-current-count=497 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruffalo’s Hulk still isn’t contractually allowed to headline his own solo film</a>, and his time as Dr. Banner may be drawing to a close as it seems that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the original Avengers are slowly being phased out in favor of the new recruits</a>, so even if the MCU continues to dominate the industry for another two decades, we’ll still be looking back on <strong>The Incredible Hulk</strong> as an anomaly, and possibly the character’s only standalone entry in the franchise’s entire back catalogue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomqimnpqwtb%2BMoqWcqpWZtqO4xGafrqSbYr%2Bmv9NmpJytXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
