Adams' Relationship Timeline Started Way Before They Were Stars</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>If you don't recognize these stars from their respective hit TV shows, then perhaps you caught them at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding last year? <a href=# class=T3D>Patrick J. Adams and Troian Bellisario's relationship timeline</a> goes a lot further back than that, though. In fact, they've been together for more than 10 years —&nbsp;before either of them hit it big.</p><p>When <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Adams and Bellisario first met</a> back in 2009, they were co-starring in the play Equivocation, according to Buzzfeed. It wasn't necessarily love at first sight —&nbsp;they started off as friends —&nbsp;but after a few breakups and makeups, they kicked their love into full gear.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Adams and Bellisario's careers kicked into full gear, too. He was cast as <a href=# class=T3D>Mike Ross on Suits</a> —&nbsp;thus <a href=# class=T3D>the Meghan Markle connection</a> —&nbsp;and she starred as <a href=# class=T3D>Spencer Hastings on Pretty Little Liars</a> for all seven seasons.</p><p>They stayed by each other's sides throughout their respective rises on the small screen, and in February 2014, the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>couple confirmed that they had gotten engaged</a>. It seems as if their relationship has continued to grow stronger ever since then, and in October 2018, they <a href=# class=T3D>welcomed their first child</a>, a daughter, into the world.</p><p>Seeing as how they've both had long careers on your favorite guilty pleasure TV shows, Adams and Bellisario are essentially a royal couple in their own right. Their relationship timeline proves that they've supported each other from day one, though, so let's take a look back at some of their most memorable moments, shall we?</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">2009: They First Meet While Co-Starring In A Play</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure><p>Once upon a time, two ambitious actors living in Los Angeles <a href=# rel=noreferrer>met in a very Hollywood way</a> — while acting together, of course. During an interview with Her World back in 2013, Adams shared that, "[he and Bellisario] did a play together in LA called Equivocation. She was cast for the part of my romantic interest. We met and that was it."</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">2009-2010: They Date, Break Up, & Patrick Wins Her Back In An Epic Way</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure><p>Despite their initial connection, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Adams and Bellisario broke up</a> after about a year of dating, according to Buzzfeed News. Adams told the outlet that parting ways wasn't his decision, though, and he basically did everything in his power to win her back —&nbsp;including auditioning for Pretty Little Liars, on which Bellisario had recently been cast.</p><p>"Troian broke up with me, and I didn't want to break up," Adams confessed to Pop Sugar. "The next day, completely un-ironically, I got an audition for her show, for a very small part on her show. A part that, at that point in my career, I would not have typically gone out for, because it was like, one day of work, on Pretty Little Liars."</p><p>Adams then went on to explain,</p>"I wanted her back, and so I went after that part with the full force of every single person that works for me in the industry. I had everyone on the phone, calling, saying, 'We're going to get this part, we're going to get this part.' I prepared for this Pretty Little Liars audition more than I've prepared for anything in my life."<p>Adams did, in fact, get the part, but <a href=# rel=noreferrer>his character didn't have any scenes with Bellisario's</a>. Still, though, his grand gesture worked, and they got back together shortly thereafter.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">2010: They Have Their First "Fort Day"</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure><p>At some point after they got back together, the couple had an unexpectedly special evening that would end up <a href=# rel=noreferrer>becoming a beloved tradition</a>. "We were tired and overworked and just wanted to have some peace and quiet. So [Adams] invited me over to his apartment where he had built us a pillow fort," Bellisario reflected in an Instagram post many years later. "</p><p>"He stapled sheets and Christmas lights to the ceiling," she explained. "We shut the door to the world outside. We didn't answer our phones. And over pancakes and movies. Long late night conversations and sleep. we got to know each other a little better. That was the first 'Fort Day.'" Swoon.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">2013: They Buy Their First Home Together</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5" readability=2><p>Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Three years after their first "Fort Day," <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Adams and Bellisario purchased a home together</a>, the PLL star revealed in an Instagram post. It was undoubtedly a big step for the couple, but considering their respectively hectic schedules, it seemingly provided them with some much-needed roots.</p><p>"It’s constant coordinating," <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Bellisario told People of their relationship</a> in October of that year. "It’s really hard to be away from the person you love, especially when they’re your rock and support system."</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">February 2014: They Confirm Their Engagement</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure><p>Following the purchase of their first home together, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Adams and Bellisario confirmed their engagement</a> to People in February 2014. While neither <a href=#>Adams nor Bellisario officially announced</a> the happy news outright themselves, Bellisario did did start sporting a diamond ring on *that* finger. Oh, and around Valentine's Day that year, she shared some very romantic photos from her and Adams' trip to Paris, one of which she captioned, "Last night was very unexpected. In the best way," as Hollywood Life pointed out.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">December 2016: They Get Married In California</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure><p>In December 2016, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Adams and Bellisario tied the knot</a> in in a beautiful, bohemian-style wedding in southern California, People confirmed.

I felt really excited. We’ve been together for a long time, so this felt like a celebration of not just what was happening that day, but everything we’d accomplished together."</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">May 2018: They Attend Prince Harry & Meghan Markle's Wedding</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5" readability=2><p>WPA Pool/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="i7p qyd">October 2018: Troian Gives Birth To Their First Child</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure><p>In October 2018, both <a href=#>Adams and Bellisario announced via Instagram</a> that they had <a href=# rel=noreferrer>welcomed their first child</a>, a baby girl, into the world.

Then, at the last moment, they said, 'Wait a minute, why isn’t Troian in the film?,' and we all agreed, and then went and made it."</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p>These two are totally a perfect match, right?
