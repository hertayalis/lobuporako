Frantiek Frk, her grandfather, won the pentathlon national championship for Czechoslovakia in 1935.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Markéta Vondroušová career</h2><p>Vondroušová now has the No. 14 position in the world according to the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA). She was the first teen major finalist in over a decade as she placed second in the 2019 French Open.</p><p>A silver medal at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics and one singles title out of four WTA Tour finals are all she has earned.</p><p>Former junior world number one Vondroušová has won two significant doubles championships. She quickly made a name for herself on the WTA Tour, taking home the victory in the 2017 Ladies Open Biel Bienne at the age of 17 in just her second WTA singles match.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/12211238/image-374.png><p>She was able to climb the WTA ranks to the top 100 before turning 18 because to this victory. Early in her career, Vondroušová suffered from injuries, most notably missing the second half of the 2019 season soon after winning the French Open.</p><p>The drop shot is one of her go-to moves. She is one of the finest returners on the WTA Tour, and among all players with at least ten matches in 2019, she led the tour in both the percentage of return games and return points earned.</p><p>Vondroušová, who had won the Junior Fed Cup in 2015, made her senior Fed Cup debut for the Czech Republic in their match against the United States in the World Group semifinals in 2017.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>CoCo Vandeweghe was the opponent she lost to in her opening match, but she bounced back to beat Lauren Davis to set up a crucial doubles rubber. The Czech team was eliminated after losing the doubles match.</p><p>In 2019’s World Group Play-off match between the Czech team and Canada, Vondroušová made a Fed Cup comeback. As the Czech Republic swept the tie to keep them in the World Group for 2020, she won two of the opening three singles sets.</p><p>She also competed for her nation at the 2020 Olympics, where in the third round of play, she defeated local favorite Naomi Osaka (6-1, 6-4).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/12211227/image-373.png><p>She qualified the Czech Republic for its first Olympic singles final by defeating fourth-seeded Elina Svitolina in the semifinals and Paula Badosa (by retirement) in the quarterfinals. Belinda Bencic defeated her in three sets, and she was given the silver medal.</p><p>She uses a wide range of shots and a deft style of play. She worked with one of her earliest coaches, Jan Fuchs, who played in a similar manner, and from him she learned this type of playing style.</p><p>She frequently uses her left-handed topspin forehand during lengthy, tactical rallies in her game. She spent her formative years playing on clay, which is now her preferred surface. As a result of her playing style, she also prefers hard courts.</p><p>More so than her service game, Vondroušová excels at her return game. With 43.4 percent of these points gained on returns, she led the WTA Tour in 2019 among players with at least ten matches.</p><p>She also led the league in both the overall return point percentage and the percentage of return games won.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Markéta Vondroušová’s husband?</h2><p>Markéta Vondroušová is married to Stepan Simek.
