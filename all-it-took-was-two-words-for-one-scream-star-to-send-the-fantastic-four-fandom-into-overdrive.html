As the kids say.” One could view his Instagram post as innocent, especially since it also featured a blurred photo of him on his bed and a shot of his arm tattoos. However, it’s the caption that has caught people’s attention.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Mason Gooding (@masonthegooding)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=413 data-injectable=true>To recap, “Flame on” is the catchphrase used by the Marvel superhero the Human Torch, one of the members of the Fantastic Four. And while it’s currently unknown if Marvel Studios has already begun casting for the upcoming MCU adaptation of the superhero team, that hasn’t stopped fans from assuming that this was his way of saying that he’s going to be playing the iconic superhero.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-42.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-43.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-44.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image-45.png><p data-characters=526 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>There have been many rumors of potential cast members for this upcoming Marvel movie. It was first rumored that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Krasinski</a> will be reprising the role of Mr. Fantastic after his appearance in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</a>. It was also rumored that Krasinski’s wife, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Emily Blunt</a>, would be cast as Sue Storm, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Krasinski’s appearance on Jimmy Fallon.</a> However, those rumors changed to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mila Kunis</a> playing the female superhero after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she was spotted with Fantastic Four director Matt Shakman.</a></p><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>While it’s currently unknown if Gooding will become the next Human Torch, it seems like he may have the body for the role. After it was revealed that the actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">will have a “shirtless scene” in Scream,</a> many fans were even more eager to watch the sixth installment of the slasher horror film. Since the Human Torch tends to have his clothes burned off when he transforms from his civilian outfit, perhaps casting him would be an excellent choice.</p><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=108 data-injectable=false>Hopefully, more news for the upcoming MCU film will be released sometime closer to its release date in 2025.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SurbiMoqtmrJ%2BkuG7DwKxkra%2BfYsSwvsOsZJ%2BnomK8r7GMrJqrnZGierTAwKtkraddqLKvsIytn55llpa7ta3SraCcZZakwrN5xZqlnaedYravwM5mpq%2Bdopm%2FqsLEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
