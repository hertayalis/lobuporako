And, most importantly, it’s a terrific film that emphasizes friendship, love, and good progress while combining unparalleled raunch with deep sincerity.</p><p>If you like Superbad and want to watch more adolescent comedies, we’ve got you covered. Put down your weird drawings and check out these seven flicks to see after Superbad.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify><strong>ADVENTURELAND</strong></h2><p style=text-align:justify>Adventureland is a considerably quieter and perhaps richer affair than Superbad, despite the fact that it is directed by the same person.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Jesse Eisenberg is an aimless college grad who takes a summer job at a local fair, meets all kinds of interesting characters played by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Martin Starr</a>, Kristen Wiig, and Bill Hader, and just might find a life-affirming spark with fellow drifter Kristen Stewart, set in the 1980s.</p><p style=text-align:justify>In this gently, warmly drawn film, the two unconventional adolescent idols find intriguing chemistry, the kind of dramedy that opens your heart and makes you homesick for a moment that never quite lived.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify><strong>BOOKSMART</strong></h2><p>Booksmart creates its own character, one that appears lovingly in conversation with high school movies of the past while proposing a welcoming future for the genre.</p><p>Insane BFF connection between Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever (and absolutely crushing their end-of-act-two-dark-night-of-the-soul argument, lensed beautifully by first-time director Olivia Wilde, to boot).</p><p>Booksmart is the type of picture that will spark global awareness in friendships; a “that’s us!” watershed.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:-<a href=# rel=noopener>20+ Movies Like Inception to Watch if You Like Twisting and Psychological Thriller Movies!</a></strong></p><h2 style=text-align:justify><strong>DAZED AND PERPLEXED</strong></h2><p>In Dazed and Confused, you get thrown into the deep end of “being a high schooler about to graduate,” which is an example of a hangout movie, a high school movie, and a “one crazy night” movie. It’s messy, but it’s worth it.</p><p>Richard Linklater, one of the best people in the world at capturing the subtlety and drama in “ordinary human conversation,” makes this film with a lot of young actors, including Ben Affleck, and Milla Jovovich, and, of course, Matthew McConaughey.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify><strong>EASY A</strong></h2><p>Emma Stone took down the boys from Superbad with ease. It was three years after that when she starred in her own teen sex comedy called Easy A. It’s a mix of Superbad and Mean Girls with a little bit of Heathers thrown in for good measure.</p><p>It’s a tart-tongued image: effervescent but also abrasive, approachable but also greedy. In this movie, The Scarlet Letter’s main idea is turned into a funny joke about sex positivity.</p><p>As you might expect, Stone owns the lead. Emma Stone is a great comedic actor.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:-<a href=# rel=noopener>Easy Season 4 Release Date: Plot, Cast, Storey & Trailer!</a></strong></p><h2 style=text-align:justify><strong>GOOD BOYS</strong></h2><p style=text-align:justify>It’s more than “Superbad re-imagined,” though that’s a fantastic starting point. Good Boys stars a trio of very young, incredibly gifted actors (Jacob Tremblay, Keith L. Williams, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Brady Noon</a>) who stumble their way through a series of shockingly filthy set pieces (including one involving Stephan Merchant that simply flabbergasted me).</p><p style=text-align:justify>But, like Superbad, the picture is interested in much more than the premise’s and cast’s first shock value. The unexpected thought that being good is good even while the ever-changing world of sixth grade surrounds you and demands you get a bit bad to grow up is presented in Good Boys. This one has a heart for days!</p><h2 style=text-align:justify><strong>HOUSE PARTY</strong></h2><p>During the 1990s, Home Party is a favorite. It asks, “What if there was a house party?”</p><p>Kid ‘n Play are the hosts of this home party (Christopher Robinson and Christopher Martin).</p><p>House Party is a “one wild night” movie with old-school grooves, broad-pitched performances, and very good dancing.</p><p>It’s time for the party’s epic ending. In Youth in Revolt, Cera plays a high school student who isn’t sure what to do. This part foreshadows his later, more intentionally controversial career choices.</p><p>To get away from his mother Jean Smart and stepfather Zach Galifianakis, Cera asks Portia Doubleday to help him make his rebellious, bad-boy alters ego “François Dillinger” under the watchful eye of filmmaker Miguel Arteta.</p><p>It’s not like the rest of the list is crazy. This bold theatrical style is usually used with a real sense of danger and gloom.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:-<a href=# rel=noopener>8 Movies Like Gone Girl: You Must Watch if You Are Die Heart Fan of Dark Tales!</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrAqa3Hmplnm5%2BifKO4zqBma2hiZ3xxgI5qcGiln6u2pr%2BMpaCknV2owrGx0ZuYnWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
