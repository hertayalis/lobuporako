According to YouTuber <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Oscar Expert</a>, it follows a woman named Sophie (Celia Rowlson-Hall) as she recalls a vacation she took with her father Calum (Paul Mescal) when she was eleven.

He described Wells as an “extraordinary” filmmaker.</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=390 data-injectable=false>“The script was the first thing I encountered and Calum is someone I knew very quickly I’d love to play.
