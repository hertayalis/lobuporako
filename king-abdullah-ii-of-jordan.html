Prince Abdullah began his education in the Jordanian capital Amman, before heading to England and, later, the United States.&nbsp;</p><p id=ecy1W9fIXh data-wc=64>After completing his military education at the prestigious Sandhurst Academy, he spent a year at Pembroke College, Oxford studying Middle Eastern Affairs in 1982, &nbsp;and attended the School Of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in 1987, again in the US. The then prince later served with the British Army before returning to his homeland to take up a post in the Jordanian Armed Forces.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ascending the throne</h2><p id=e-inJPFmpy data-wc=67>Although Hussein's eldest son represented his father in a diplomatic capacity while pursuing his military career, it was thought Abdullah would not succeed King Hussein, especially as the king had named his own younger brother Hassan as heir. However, two weeks before his death in January 1999, King Hussein named Abdullah as his successor. The King died on 7 February 1999, and Abdullah ascended the throne immediately.</p><h2>Personal life and marriage</h2><p id=eRtpwTI3c8 data-wc=70>A man of action, Abdullah is a scuba diving and automobile racing fan. A former Jordanian Rally Racing Champion, he is also a qualified frogman, pilot and freefall parachutist. He's also a keen collector of ancient weapons and armaments. Disguising himself in various wigs and plain clothing, early in his rule he gained a reputation for mingling anonymously with his subjects in order to gauge public opinion about his rule.</p><p id=eFkckV61IR data-wc=84>King Abdullah II met his wife, Kuwait-born Palestinian <a class=hm-link href=#>Queen Rania</a>, at a dinner party given by one of his sisters in 1993 and, by all accounts, it was love at first sight. The two were married in June of that year and have four children: <a class=hm-link href=#>Crown&nbsp;Prince Hussein</a>, born in 1994; <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Iman</a>, born in 1996; Princess Salma, born in 2000 and Prince Hashem, born in 2005. When Abdullah took the throne in 1999, Rania was, at 29, the youngest queen in the world. &nbsp;</p><p id=elMAKKC25qF data-wc=15>For all the latest news about King Abdullah II and the Jordanian royals, <a class=hm-link href=#>click here</a>.</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_l1bj44ck>More Profiles</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9tZ5ueu6h5wJubrqSclrVutchmpp9lmqS%2Fpa3NaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
