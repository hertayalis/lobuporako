Use a turkey baster and hot water to flush the defrost drain to melt the ice that has formed within it. If your defrost drain freezes on a frequent basis, you may want to consider installing a drain heater to melt the ice in the drain.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>Similarly, individuals inquire as to why their freezer is leaking water onto the floor.</h3><p>The defrost water will be discharged via the freezer drain hose into a drip pan located at the bottom of the freezer. When this pan gets overflowing, it will begin to spill water onto the floor underneath it. This is a routine maintenance activity that must be completed anytime the freezer defrosts. If there is any water escaping from the drain line and the drip pan is not full, check the drain hose.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>In the same vein, why does my freezer leak into my refrigerator?</h3><p>Defrost Drain has become clogged. According to appearances, leaking water inside the refrigerator is typically less significant than water stains on the kitchen floor. It seemed that the defrost drain was the source of the problem.
