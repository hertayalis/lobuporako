Typically, his affairs would not bother Persephone, but when Minthe arrogantly bragged that she was more beautiful than Persephone and that she would win Hades back, Persephone took revenge. Persephone turned Minthe into what we know today as the mint plant.<h2>Did Hades love Persephone or Minthe?</h2>One version of Persephone's story told by the Roman poet Ovid might suggest she had grown some feelings of affection for Hades in spite of everything. In Ovid's famous text Metamorphosis, Hades has an affair with a young Nymph named Minthe.<h2>How did Persephone get revenge on Minthe?</h2>The plant is named for the nymph Minthe, whom Persephone caught in the arms of her husband, Pluto. The enraged Persephone threw her on the ground and trampled her, but she lives on, we are assured by ancient myth, as mint.<h2>Don't make Persephone angry! The story of Minthe & other Mint myths</h2><p></p><h2>Why does Persephone's hair grow so fast?</h2>She has been described as being extremely beautiful, even rivaling Aphrodite in various circumstances. Her hair, which dissolves into flower petals when cut, is connected to her emotional state -- growing abnormally fast in moments of extreme stress or excitement.<h2>Who was the ugliest god?</h2>Hephaestus. Hephaestus is the son of Zeus and Hera. Sometimes it is said that Hera alone produced him and that he has no father. He is the only god to be physically ugly.<h2>Who killed Minthe?</h2>14 (trans.

When Persephone was abducted, Minthe was cast aside by Hades.</p><h2>Was Hades abusive to Persephone?</h2>Because Hades is only depicted as a predator in this myth, there is this desire to “redeem” him and pain his actions as a result of sorrow or a misunderstanding. However, in every version of the story, Hades kidnaps her—violently, and that is abusive, even if she forgives him for it.<h2>Did Apollo sleep with Persephone?</h2>No, Persephone was not raped by Apollo. Apollo was merely an interested suitor when Persephone became of age and was actively looking for a husband. But Persephone was raped by her father not once, but two times. In both occurrences, she bore a child.<h2>Did Aphrodite sleep with Hades?</h2>Portrayed as both insatiable and unattainable, Aphrodite was born near the coast of Cythera out of the foam (aphros) Uranus' castrated genitals created when they fell into the sea. Even though married to Hephaestus, she had affairs with all Olympians except Zeus and Hades, most famously with Ares, the god of war.<h2>Did Hades marry his niece?</h2>Yes, Hades was married to his niece, Persephone. Persephone's mother was the goddess Demeter. Demeter and Hades were siblings.<h2>Does Hera ever cheat on Zeus?</h2>Zeus set a decree that the gods were not allowed to interfere in the mortal war. Hera is on the side of the Achaeans, so she plans a Deception of Zeus where she seduces him, with help from Aphrodite, and tricks him into a deep sleep, with the help of Hypnos, so that the Gods could interfere without the fear of Zeus.<h2>Who did Persephone love?</h2>Persephone & Hades<p>According to mythology, Hades, god of the Underworld, fell in love with beautiful Persephone when he saw her picking flowers one day in a meadow.</p><h2>What does Hades smell like?</h2>Hades Scent<p>Hades contains notes of belladonna, amber, oak moss, orris, opium, cypress, and narcissus. The scent has a dream like quality and smells more like silver stardust than death and decay.</p><h2>How much older is Hades than Persephone?</h2>Hear me out. He's 2000 years old canonically and Persephone is 19.<h2>Who is the god of poop?</h2>Sterculius is the god in question. He's Roman, not Greek. And “feces” is kind of stretching a point. He was the god, actually, of manure.<h2>Who is the god of stupidity?</h2>In Greek mythology, Koalemos (Ancient Greek: Κοάλεμος) was the god of stupidity, mentioned once by Aristophanes, and being found also in Parallel Lives by Plutarch. Coalemus is the Latin spelling of the name. Sometimes it is referred to as a dæmon, more of a spirit and minor deity.<h2>Who was the prettiest god?</h2>Aphrodite was the most beautiful of all the Goddesses and there are many tales of how she could encourage both Gods and humans to fall in love with her.<h2>Did Zeus seduce Persephone?</h2>Persephone was seduced by Zeus when he took the shape of her abductor/husband, Hades. Kallisto of Arkadia (southern Greece) was seduced by Zeus in the form of Artemis. In anger, Artemis transformed her into a bear, and she bore a son, Arkas.<h2>What color is Persephone's eyes?</h2>In Percy Jackson's Greek Gods, Persephone was described to be an incredibly beautiful young goddess with tender expression. Before the seasons began, her eyes were sky blue like her father's and her hair was blond like her mother's.<h2>Did Persephone and Ares hook up?</h2>Although the two love each other deeply, they are not exclusive and openly sleep with multiple partners. Ares kisses Persephone in the mortal realm and later flirts with her in the house he shares with Aphrodite. There appears to be an unspoken rule for Aphrodite to never sleep with Ares' Father, Zeus.<h2>Who raped Persephone Olympus?</h2>One of the most important story threads in the entire comic is the rape of Persephone by the sun god Apollo.
