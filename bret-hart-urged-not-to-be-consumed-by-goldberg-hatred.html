This is because Bret Hart suffered a concussion after Goldberg hit him with a botched kick during a match at Starrcade in 1999.</p><p>Due to this, Bret Hart suffered post-concussion syndrome, which forced him to prematurely hang up his pro wrestling boots.&nbsp;<a href=#>Bret Hart went on record and said</a>&nbsp;that Goldberg’s work rate was “0/10.”&nbsp;</p><p>While speaking on&nbsp;<a href=#>Keepin It 100</a>, Konnan talked about working with Goldberg in WCW and also Bret Hart’s hatred for Goldberg. Konnan advised Bret Hart to not be consumed by his hatred for Goldberg.</p><p>“How could you? The match was thirty seconds long… You know, he never hurt me. But he was a little bit clumsy ’cause he was new and he hadn’t really been trained and he had a great aura and they [WCW] were going to take advantage of it, much like when I started.</p><p>So, one guy is mad [Bret Hart] that he can’t do what he loves, you know, and the guy that was never trained and probably didn’t love it like him was the guy that hurt him, you know. But you need to let go bro ’cause it will consume you.”&nbsp;</p><p>Fans wonder how the wrestling world would have been different had Bret Hart still been able to wrestle. Regardless, Bret Hart had previously forgiven Goldberg for what he did as well, but that doesn’t mean Hart still won’t harbor a grudge.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What do you think of this Bret Hart story?
