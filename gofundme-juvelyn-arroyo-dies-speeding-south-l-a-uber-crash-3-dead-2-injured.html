Uber Crash: 3 dead, 2 injured</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ghsplash.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/download-2-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Three people were killed Saturday morning after an&nbsp;Uber&nbsp;was t-boned at a&nbsp;South Los Angeles&nbsp;intersection near the Westmont community of unincorporated&nbsp;Los Angeles County, according to officials.</h2><p>Two others in the Uber were injured in the crash.</p><p>It happened just before 5:30 a.m. at the intersection of South Vermont Avenue and West Century Boulevard, the&nbsp;California Highway Patrol&nbsp;reported.</p><p>Officials said the Uber, a black Honda, was heading north on Vermont, when a white Mercedes heading west on Century ran the red light and plowed into the Honda.</p><p>There were five people in the Uber, including the driver. Three passengers in the back seat, all women, were killed in the crash. They have been identified as 23-year-old Juvelyn Arroyo, 23-year-old Veronica Amezola, and 27-year-old Kimberly Izquierdo. Police later said that two of the three women killed were sisters, but did not say which of three were related.</p><p>Another passenger, a man sitting in the front seat, was hospitalized and is in stable condition.</p><p>The Uber driver, a woman, was also sent to the hospital and is in critical condition.</p><p>Police told FOX 11’s Gigi Graciette that there was one man in the Mercedes, and that the car was traveling at about 85 mph at the time of the crash.</p><p>“He [passed] the vehicles that were stopped at the red light, doing the right thing. He passes on the left side of them, into the turn lanes and goes around them and strikes the victims,” said LAPD Det. Ryan Moreno. “And you’re talking about going 85, 90 mph at least.”</p><p>Officials later identified that driver as 31-year-old Gregory Black.</p><p>The impact of the crash was so violent, police said, that one of the women in the back seat of the Uber was ejected from the car.</p><p>“It’s just frustrating,” said Sgt. Clarence Perkins. “Because just think about if you just drive the speed limit, slow down, obey the laws of the land, this wouldn’t happen. This is actually preventable.”</p><p>The LAPD announced Sunday that Black had been arrested and would be facing vehicular manslaughter charges for his alleged role in the crash.</p><p>LAPD detectives are still investigating what happened before the early morning crash, including the possibility that the driver of the Mercedes was fleeing another crime scene.</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
