After announcing Kaluuya's victory, however, the actor's audio was muted as he began his acceptance speech, which led to the camera panning back to Dern and the actress apologizing for the "technical difficulties."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's unclear whether Kaluuya had forgotten to unmute his audio while beginning his speech or if it was a difficulty on the Globe production team's end, but eventually, Kaluuya was able to speak and hilariously quipped, "We got this! We got this!" before going into his speech.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kaluuya took home the award for his portrayal of Chicago Black Panther chairman Fred Hampton in the acclaimed Shaka Kingâ€“directed film Judas and the Black Messiah. "I hope a whole generation after this can see how [Frank Hampton] fought, how brilliantly he spoke, and how brilliantly he loved," said Kaluuya, honoring the late activist who inspired the film. "[This movie] taught me about myself, made me grow as a man, and I appreciate that with all my heart."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Along with Kaluuya's acting nod, Judas and the Black Messiah was also nominated for Best Song Motion Picture, for "Fight for You" by H.E.R.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/4daa8765-4788-452b-b976-683922ffb919_1660573271.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" title="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Bianca Betancourt is the culture editor at <a href=# rel=noopener>HarpersBAZAAR.com</a>, where she covers all things film, TV, music, and more.
