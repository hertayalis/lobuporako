As <a href=#>Mix Mag</a> reported, the incident took place in 2012 at the Australian festival Future Music, where rapper Ninja chased down Butler, who is openly gay. "Run, f****t, run. Run for your life b***h," Ninja's musical partner, Yolandi, can be heard yelling. Later in the video, the pair decide to pretend that Butler had assaulted Yolandi, and she pretends to cry, which Ninja describes as "Oscar Award-winning."</p><p>Their Facebook explanation, where the pair claimed that the video was just "cleverly edited," didn't win them back any fans. Ninja denied that they had antagonized Butler because of his sexuality, insisting that it was "just a fight with someone who f***ed with us." On top of the controversial video, several women have also come forward to accuse Ninja of sexual assault, per <a href=#>The Sydney Morning Herald</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The band's reputation has led to them being cut from a number of U.S. musical festivals, including&nbsp;Life Is Beautiful in Las Vegas and Louder Than Life in Kentucky, per Mix Mag. And their behavior was still losing Die Antwoord gigs in 2021, with <a href=#>Kerrang!</a>&nbsp;reporting that they were dropped from the&nbsp;ALT+LDN festival after other performers complained about the group being part of the lineup.</p><p>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.
