Longtime viewers of the range of beloved Power Rangers offerings gobbled up the latest and found themselves delighted by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">several callbacks and Easter eggs</a> paying homage to the wealth of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">existing Power Rangers content</a>. One such Easter egg was nestled into an easily-missed conversation in Once & Always, but some fans caught onto the show’s sidelong mention of Cestria.</p><h2 id=h-who-is-cestria data-injectable=false>Who is Cestria?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=557 data-current-count=857 data-injectable=true>Its been quite awhile since Cestria made her last appearance in the Power Rangers universe, but loyal fans of the show quickly caught on to a mention of the character. She made her first and only appearance in episode 48 of Power Rangers Zeo, as Billy Cranston’s final love interest. When the vital character made his initial exit from the series, his absence was explained away using Cestria. After meeting the Aquitar native, Billy fell hard for Cestria and chose to stay on Aquitar with her, rather than return to Earth and his duties as a Ranger.</p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>A minor, but delightful, nod to Billy’s long-ago exit was nestled into a conversation in Once & Always, when Adam tells Billy that his lady love is missing him. Near the end of the special, he encourages Billy to return to Aquitar with him, and notes that Cestria is eager to see him again. The short-lived, but well-loved, character was played by Steffanie Malanga in the 1996 show.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=false>This is the only mention of Cestria <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in the special</a>, and the alien doesn’t make an actual appearance in the flick, but fans were still delighted to hear a reference to that long-forgotten episode in the 2023 return to Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlk5rAtb7ImmSipl2lvLix0WapmqaXmr%2B0ec2eq5%2Bkma3AbrvNnJxmmZysrrq%2FjJ6YrKyVp3qms8ZmnLGonJa2r7HDaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
