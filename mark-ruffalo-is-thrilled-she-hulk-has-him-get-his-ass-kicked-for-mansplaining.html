But she doesn’t need it, it’s not what she needs. And now he has someone to relate to and it’s real and she’s his equal. She kicks his ass and she kicks his ego too. There’s a lot of freedom in getting your ass kicked that way — it allows him to grow and be something other than he thinks he is, or bigger than he thinks he is.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/She-Hulk-Poster.jpg><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=false>There’s presumably no way to train yourself into becoming the ideal gamma-radiated chunk of muscle, as we’ve seen through the disparate arcs of both Bruce Banner and Emil Blonsky, with Jennifer now set to join them. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">We can already hear the internet crying foul at the blatant feminism on display</a>, which is ironic when there’s going to be an awful lot of people this time tomorrow trying to mansplain why She-Hulk sucks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yurdGkZKutlpuurbuMoqpmrJintq24xJ1krKCVYrW2uMpmn5qrXZ22rnnGnqtmoJmoeqK%2F0maiopubmrFuss6rZKaZnqi9ra3Ip6Cnn18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
