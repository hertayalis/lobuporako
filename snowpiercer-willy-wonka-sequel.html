Internet theorists believe Bong Joon-Ho's 2013 creation is somehow linked to the children's classic.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><p>Everyone loves a solid internet conspiracy theory, and we recently discovered one regarding Snowpiercer, the 2013 Bong Joon-Ho blockbuster that was recently remade into a TNT TV series. If you aren't familiar with the post-apocalyptic thriller, it's all about people surviving in a totally frozen wasteland of a world, by living their lives on a train that continuously circulates the earth.</p><p>How did the internet collectively decide that <a href=#>Snowpiercer is a sequel to Willy Wonka</a>? The theory is outlandish but overall totally captivating, however, if you haven't seen either film, prepare for some spoilers.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: GIPHY</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Theme-wise, 'Willy Wonka' and 'Snowpiercer' are quite similar.</h2><p>A number of YouTube accounts have created videos to dissect the similarities between Willy Wonka and Snowpiercer, and we dove in with YouTuber <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rhino Stew</a>'s examination. The creator, known for think pieces and essays, opened up the conversation by noting that both productions are quite similar thematically, telling the story of groups of people who aim to work their way through a fantastical structure (Wonka's factory, and a large train circulating the planet).</p><p>In both movies, the main characters are removed one by one from their journey until someone makes it to the end, only to find out they are needed to succeed a wealthy industrialist. Both plots revolve around themes of class structure, children, and food while examining the ideas of sacrifice, choice, and free will. Each movie also plays into the idea that people have roles they are destined to fill.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: GIPHY</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Willy Wonka's Charlie Bucket may have grown up to be Wilford.</h2><p>It's believed that Charlie Bucket may have taken Willy Wonka's name, thus becoming the movie's main character, Wilford, (played by Ed Harris). The theory assumes after years of running a factory, building unusual modes of transportation, and utilizing chemistry and engineering skills on a regular basis, Charlie could have easily left the factory behind, and built a super self-sustaining train.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, it's believed that Charlie (who became Wilford) may have figured out a way to fix global warming by cooling down the earth. Now, he is seeking a successor to take over running the train, by hiding clues in food, just as Wonka had for him.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Other characters in 'Snowpiercer' emulate Charlie's fellow contestants.</h2><p>The theory notes that Mike TV, who was a violent child with an obsession with media, may have grown into the silent deadly gunman, Franco, who ironically makes his first kill on TV. Meanwhile, Minister Mason, who loves fur coats and is always first to enter a room, could most likely be an adult version of the spoiled child, Veruca Salt. After her near-death experience, the theory alleges she's forever grateful to Wilford, as Charlie had saved her life.</p><p>It's also believed that Snowpiercer's child-catcher, Claude, may be the daughter of Augustus Gloop — she's a big eater, tends to snack on non-food items, and has terrible impulse control. The similarities are uncanny.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But what happened to the Oompa Loompas?</h2><p>The theory believes Oompa Loompas may have gone extinct — the train was required to be operated by tiny people, but it seems like the Oompa Loompas may have died off, potentially due to the inclemete weather, or because of an inability to reproduce.</p><p>Are these connections a stretch? Maybe, but we're definitely going to continue looking out for similarities when we binge the new Snowpiercer series.</p><p>Snowpiercer premieres on TNT on Sunday, May 17 at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLuww8%2BinKublad6uLXLpbBmr5%2BjuKJ50p6orp2c</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
