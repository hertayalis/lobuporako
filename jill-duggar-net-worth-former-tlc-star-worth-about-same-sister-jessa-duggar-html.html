As the second oldest daughter of parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, <a href=#>Jill Duggar</a> is used to being in the public eye. She began her career as a young teen, showcasing her position in the family that continued to grow as the 19 Kids & Counting cameras rolled. She found even further fame on her own show, <a href=#>Counting On</a>,&nbsp; which premiered in 2015 and ran for approximately two seasons. These days, she and her husband <a href=#>Derick Dillard</a> have two children. Over the years, Jill Duggar has broken a bit from her family’s beliefs while continuing to build her net worth through several ventures. Now, it is said that the former TLC star is worth about the same as her sister, Jessa Duggar.</p><h2 id=h-why-did-jill-and-derick-leave-counting-on>Why did Jill and Derick leave ‘Counting On’?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jill-duggar-net-worth.jpg><p id=par-2_73>When someone finds success in the lucrative world of reality television, they usually don’t want that time to come to an end. However, the Dillards seemed pretty enthusiastic about making their escape from the show, leaving many fans wondering exactly why. Although many speculated the couple was fired from Counting On because of Derick’s controversial comments about fellow TLC star Jazz Jennings, Jill has since explained why they decided to leave the show.</p><p id=par-3_35>She told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>, “We just wanted more control of our own lives. There was a certain job that we had been working towards for, even before we were married, that was taken away from us.”</p><p id=par-4_52>Additionally, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ET Online</a> reports that the pretty reality star wasn’t even paid for her time on the show. She revealed that while she was promised $25,000 to $45,000 per episode, she didn’t see a nickel of it until after she quit the show — and she had to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">get an attorney involved</a>.</p><h2 id=h-jill-duggar-and-derick-dillard-s-net-worth-is-similar-to-that-of-jessa-and-ben-seewald>Jill Duggar and Derick Dillard’s net worth is similar to that of Jessa and Ben Seewald</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_75>There are some reality stars who bring in millions of dollars per year, which is why the net worth of Jill and Derick Dillard may be a bit surprising. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The List</a> reports that while the couple’s net worth is not in the seven-figure range; currently, it sits between $400,000 and $500,000, even though they have been in the spotlight for a number of years. This is pretty similar to Jessa and her husband, Ben Seewald.</p><p id=par-6_29>Jill and Derick have said, “Our control to choose what jobs we were allowed to accept and even where we were allowed to live was taken away from us”.</p><h2 id=h-what-are-jill-and-derick-up-to-today>What are Jill and Derick up to today?&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_69>They’ve had an interesting ride, so what are Jill and Derick up to today? According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly</a>, Derick graduated from law school, a major accomplishment for anyone to achieve. He and Jill are continuing to distance themselves from the rest of the Duggar clan, and Derick is reportedly working on a tell-all book which he says will expose some of the Duggar family’s secrets, according to and <a href=#>TVShowsAce</a>.</p><p id=par-8_56>These days, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">couple</a> has been spending plenty of time together with their children as a family, recently taking a much-needed vacation in Oregon.
