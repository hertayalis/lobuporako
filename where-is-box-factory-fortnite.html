There are a bunch of other items players can use as disguises right now — like the henchmen ones that came in handy to complete the phone booth challenge, where players had to disguise themselves in three different phone booths around the man.</p><p>These Creepin' Cardboard boxes are similar to that, giving the player a box to hide inside of. Right now, the boxes can be found in random locations around the map, if you're just looking to use them for play, and also at the Box Factory.</p><p>If you're looking for a Creepin' Cardboard to complete the challenge for the chapter, you'll need to hide in one specifically at the Box Factory.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Where is the Box Factory in 'Fortnite'?</h2><p>Since the Box Factory isn't considered a point of interest, it isn't named anywhere on the map, sending the player on a wild goose chase to find it.</p><p>But if you're still struggling to locate the Box Factory, we don't blame you.</p><p>The factory is actually located in the G7 grid square, southwest of Retail Row but southeast of Lazy Lake. If you're still confused, you may remember the location because of the mysterious "redacted" bunker that's been cut into the mountain nearby.
